A simple (or not) audio selector switch using arduino Uno (Can be used stand alone) and two shift registers, plus displaying the choices in a 16x2 LCD. I've managed to do this project after seeing a few bits of code here and there, plus adding some stuff of mine. Feel free to use it and improve it, I'm a true newbie on Arduino and programming, despite playing with electronics for almost 30 years!
